# gas-thruster-stabilization
Our project is to design and build a gas thruster reaction control system. Gas RCS thrusters are a type of rocket engine that use pressurized gas to generate thrust and control the attitude and steering of an aircraft. 

The design consists of:
- A fuel tank
- A regulating valve
- A propelling nozzle

Our minimum viable product is to produce one working thruster. Beyond that, we hope to implement multiple thrusters (3) onto a drone, and as an extra stretch we would like to introduce an RF component to remotely control the thrusters and drone
